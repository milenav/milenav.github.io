                    <p>
                        Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
                        And sorry I could not travel both
                        And be one traveler, long I stood
                        And looked down one as far as I could
                        To where it bent in the undergrowth;

                        Then took the other, as just as fair,
                        And having perhaps the better claim,
                        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
                        Though as for that the passing there
                        Had worn them really about the same,

                        And both that morning equally lay
                        In leaves no step had trodden black.
                        Oh, I kept the first for another day!
                        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
                        I doubted if I should ever come back.

                        I shall be telling this with a sigh
                        Somewhere ages and ages hence:
                        Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
                        I took the one less traveled by,
                        And that has made all the difference.
