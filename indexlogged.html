                    <p>
                        As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
                        bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
                        and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
                        blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
                        sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
                        report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
                        he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
                        properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
                        that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
                        differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
                        are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
                        with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
                        and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
                        brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
                        which his animals on his dunghills are as much
                        bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
                        plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
                        me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
                        me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
                        brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
                        gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
                        grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
                        think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
                        servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
                        know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
